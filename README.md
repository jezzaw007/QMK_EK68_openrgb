# QMK_EK68_openrgb
This repo was to create a new QMK firmware for Epomaker EK68 with OpenRGB support
However, I forgot that I had previously researched the EK68 knowing that EpoMaker were rebadging as their own and under the hood it was a Zuoya GMK67.

I then researched for the GMK67 firmware which you will find here, and then came across an archived project for GNK67 firmware here

How to flash firmware.
Ensure the mode selector is in wired mode not MAC or Windows wireless mode
Hold the DEL key and insert the USB power cable to enter flash mode
