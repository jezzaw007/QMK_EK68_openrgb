## 🧠 QMK_EK68_OpenRGB

This repo was created to develop a custom **QMK firmware** for the **Epomaker EK68** with **OpenRGB** support.

However, I later rediscovered that the EK68 is a rebadged version of the **Zuoya GMK67**, which I had previously researched.  
So instead of reinventing the wheel, I pivoted to adapting existing GMK67 firmware.

You can find the archived GMK67 OpenRGB firmware project here:

## 🔧 How to Flash Firmware

1. **Set the mode selector to wired mode** (not MAC or Windows wireless mode).
2. **Hold the `DEL` key** and insert the USB power cable to enter flash mode.
3. **Flash the device** using your preferred tool.  
   ⚠️ _Do not disconnect power until the process completes._
